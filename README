README for test run of Chymera code

This distrubution contains the source files for chymera as well as a makefile and two run scripts for PBS and direct login.

The code runs with radiation, full EOS, no planet and no fluid elements. It requires only GSL libraries which can be obtained at http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gsl/. Set environment variables GSL_LIBPATH and GSL_INCPATH to point at your GSL installation. 

The source can be built as a parallel binary with the intel compilers via
>make COMPILE=intel
To compile the serial binary use
>make COMPILE=intel OMP=no

Other compilers are in the Makefile, but have not been tested. 

Run with runchymera or submit with chymera.sub
