!    Most of the following variables are used in the source routine only. 
!    torp is one ORP in code time units, defined as 2*pi/omega(200,2,1) 
!    of the starting model.
!    cq = 3 for AV on, 0 for AV off. 
!    irtype = 0 for no irr, 1 for irradiation.
!    ictype is the cooling type: 1 for const. Tcool, 2 for 
!    Edd. grey atm. only, 3 for diff. aprox., 4 for diff. 
!    aprox. with shining atm.
!    cct is only used when using type 1.  It is the cooling
!    time in ORPS.      
!    tcoollmt is the lower limit of cooling time in ORP.
!    tirrlmt  is the lower limit of irradiation time in ORP.
!    Tbgrnd is the lower limit of the temperature
!    irop is used to spread the irradiation to a few more cells by dividing the
!    opacities by some number. 
!    jirr is the first first j zone to be irradiated.
!    jcool is the j zone at which cooling starts.  Disabled in most ictypes.
!    fk = metallicity factor: fraction of standard metallicity to keep.
!    tenvk = constant envelop temperature
!    SETUNITS = 0 for polytropic units (G=K=M=1) and 1 for Aaron's units
!       (G=1, 1 R = 1 AU, 1 M = Msun)
!    Use H2STAT to select what type of mixture you want.
!    0 = pure para
!    1 = pure ortho -- this is not really physical for astro applications
!    2 = set mixture
!    3 = equilibrium
!    4 = single gamma law
!    Be sure to set ac and bc for mixture (ac: para component, bc: ortho component)
!    also pick a metallicity by adjusting xabun, yabun, and zabun.
!  
!    star_state can take 1 of 4 values they are:
!    fixed -- The traditional method of fixing the star to the center of 
!             the grid.
!    indirect -- Transform to a non-inertial frame with the star at the 
!                grid center and add the potential due to an accelerated
!                frame. If a lot of mass is leaving the grid you shouldn't
!                use this since it won't account for it
!    wiggle -- Has the same effect as star_wiggle=.true. and restart_wiggle
!              =.false.
!    wiggle_restart -- Same effect as star_wiggle=.true. and restart_wiggle
!                      =.true.
!
!    ISTOR2 sets how often saved and coolheat_full files are output.
!    make sure that ISTOR2 is a multiple of IDIAG in fort.5 or the output
!    won't work correctly.	
!    outpath is the path to the ouput files, use ./ if you want files in
!    the same directory as the binary you are executing.
